I suggest these matter most:

\item Be relevant (each talk is tailored to the particular audience)
\item Be awake (you haven't spent all night writing your talk, nor socializing)
\item Learn your lines (even if you are reading it out, you should know key formulations and be able to quote from memory)
\item Practice giving it  (practice the talk every day for seven days before, and practice similing at your audience while speaking) 
\item Know your timings (you won't know exactly how much time you have in advance, so be sure you can seamlessly cut material or speed up)

But what about the supporting materials, your slides and handouts?
The first thing I want to say is that you should always both use slides and distribute a 
handout.</div><div class="container_12"><div class="grid_12 "><div class="words"><div class="middle"><p class="center huge-glow the-talk hide">talk</p></div></div></div></div><div style="position: absolute; top:0; left:0; width:100%; height:100%;"><div class="container_12"><div class="grid_12 "><div class="words"><div class="middle"><p class="center slides-and-handout"><span class="the-slides">slides</span><span> + </span><span class="the-handout">handout</span></p><p class="center"><span class="design hide">design</span><span class="design-avoid hide">: avoid</span></p></div></div></div></div></div><div data-what=" .the-handout" data-class="bkg-words-highlight-invert" class="slide anim-continue anim-addclass"></div><div data-what="#notanelement" data-class="" class="slide anim-addclass"></div><div class="notes">Handouts are going out of fashion but I believe you should always create a handout.
Before I say why, let me ask you.
\textbf{What are the functions a handout can serve when you are giving a talk?}</div><div class="notes">There are two excellent reasons for using a handout.</div><div class="notes">The first is that they allow your audience to jump around different parts of your talk 
and to return to key claims and quotes.  
This is particularly useful in discussion.
Let me put it this way.
There is a tendency for discussion of a talk to focus on the last thing the speaker said.
This is probably because people can't easily remember things the speaker said further back in the 
talk.
You can improve the situation by providing a handout that helps people to recall material from
several parts of your talk.</div><div class="notes">Using a handout in this way will also facilitate better disucssion after the talk, either 
later in the day during social events or, sometimes, even days later.</div><div class="notes">The second reason for using a handout is this.
Everyone present has your name and email address in their hands.
You shouldn't underestimate the importance of this.  
For a typical audience with a typical speaker name, I'd guess that less than half will remember 
your name even 10 minutes into the talk.
And of course you want people to have your email address so they can ask you questions after.</div><div class="notes">So much for why you should use a handout.
What makes a good handout?
\begin{enumerate}
\item Your name and institutional email address are on it, of course.
\item It presents the structure of your argument
\item It contains quotes, claims and anything else the audience might want to ask about
\item It provides useful citations
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Am I missing anything?}</div><div class="notes">One issue to consider with handouts is how much you are prepared to put on them.
At one extreme, 
some people provide multi-page handouts that are like a compressed version of the paper they're 
giving.
When I get these handouts, I usually spend a fair bit of the talk not listening but reading the 
handout.   I also usually read ahead of the speaker.
The other extreme is just to put quotes, citations and key claims onto the handout.
When I get these handouts, I usually write quite detailed notes in the talk in which I try to 
capture the structure of the talk and its main arguments.
I'm torn between these two extremes; I associate the more extensive handouts with better 
presentations, but I also like the idea that in attending a talk I'm focussed on the speaker and 
not just reading a papers.
\textbf{Help me out here.  What do you think?}</div><div data-what=" .the-handout" data-class="bkg-words-highlight-invert" class="slide anim-continue anim-removeclass"></div><div data-what=" .the-slides" data-class="bkg-words-highlight-invert" class="slide anim-continue anim-addclass"></div><div data-what="#notanelement" data-class="" class="slide anim-addclass"></div><div class="notes">I've just been saying that 
the primary function of a handout is to allow the audience to understand the structure and central
points of your talk without actually listening to what you say very carefully.
\textbf{Why use slides in presenting your research?}</div><div class="notes">Here are three reasons.
First, well-crafted slides will allow people who drift off to see whether you have moved on to a 
new point or not.
(Look at this slide and ask youself, Is he still waffling about handouts or has he moved on?  You can 
tell that I've moved on, surely?)
Second, slides allow you to underline things without making people search through a handout.
(You've seen a couple of examples of this in this talk, e.g. I used a slide to emphasise 
you should practice your talk for seven days before giving it.)
Third, using slides means that people are not looking at you all the time.</div><div class="notes">So here's my opinion.
You do not present your research on your slides, except where using diagrams or charts.
Rather your slides work in roughly the way that manual gestures do.
They provide emphasis at key points, and they indicate where one point ends and another begins.
\textbf{This is just one quite extreme opinion.  But I'm curious.  Who agrees with me about slides?  Are there more plausible views about the function of slides?}</div><div class="notes">So much for what slides are for.
What makes a good slide deck?
\begin{enumerate}
\item transitions between slides clearly convey transitions in the structure of the talk
\item the right points are emphasised
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Am I missing anything?}</div><div class="notes">Before we move on, I also want to ask, What makes a bad slide deck?
(Bad handouts are typically the result of insufficient preparation, whereas it's possible to spend
arbitrarily long amounts of time preparing a truly atrocious slide deck.)</div><div class="notes">So what makes a bad slide deck?
\begin{enumerate}
\item the slide deck is the speaker's talk notes
\end{enumerate}
A lot of philosophers prepare a talk by writing sentences onto slides, and then show the slides
while they are talking.
This is terrible practice for at least three reasons.
First, your slides become a distraction from your talk.
Second, it makes your talk more boring than necessary.
Third, it's harder to read and listen simultaneously than to just do one or the other.
Your talk notes and your slides have completely different functions, so one cannot serve as the other.

You should never need to read your slides while giving a talk.
If you find yourself reading your slides, you have not prepared meticulously.

I want to encourage you not to worry about design too much.
For some people, cut and paste is something they do with scissors and glue.
I think this is fine.
I've seen beautiful handouts and I've seen handouts that have been literally glued together and
then photocopied.  As long as I can easily navigate through and read them, I think the design is not 
critical.</div><div data-what=".design-avoid" data-class="hide" data-scope="" class="slide anim-continue anim-removeclass"></div><div data-what="#notanelement" data-class="" class="slide anim-addclass"></div><div class="notes">Let me put it like this.
Meticulous preparation demands hours of your time.
So if you prepare meticulously, you probably don't have time for design.
Just try to avoid obvious mistakes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item print large and use generous margins
\item use a one font, colour and size 
\item never animate anything
\end{enumerate}</div><div class="notes">There are several talks I can remember for extraneous reasons; Joel Smith used a particularly nice
quality of paper for a handout at a talk at the joint session when we were graduate students,
and Gergo Csibra gave a talk here in Warwick with weird animated symbols.
But I can't remember the content of any of these talks.</div></section><section class="slide"><div class="container_12"><div class="grid_12 "><div class="words"><div class="middle"><div class="notes">One last thing.
We've just been talking about how to use slides and handouts in presenting your research.
But the key thing in giving a talk is that you are there with the audience in one room
(or usually).  So ...</div><p class="center notes ctd show">let your body express your ideas</p><div class="notes">This sounds like a funny thing to emphasise.  
But if you aren't doing this, should you be presenting your research by giving a talk at all?</div><div class="notes">Make sure people can see your face and your hands.
Don't have anything in your hands.
Look at your audience.</div></div></div></div></div></section><section id="unit_writing_an_abstract" class="slide"><img src="http://www.butterfill.com/talk-slides/presenting_your_research/img/bkg/bees/DSC_0169_crop.jpg" class="bkg"/><div class="spacer">&nbsp;</div><div style="" class="title-block"><div class="title-container"><h2 class="title1">Writing an Abstract</h2></div><div class="notes">Many people will first encounter your research through an abstract, either for your thesis or else for a talk or publication.

A thesis abstract might be read by (i) hiring committees, (ii) curious people in your research area,
and (iii) other students.
The abstract for a journal paper or conference talk will first be read by an editor and reviewers.
Later it will hopefully be read by people working in your area, and especially by people
wondering whether to read your paper or attend your talk.</div><div class="notes">I guess the thesis abstract has to be accessible to the widest possible audience, whereas
this is perhaps not desirable in the case of an abstract for a talk at a specialist conference or 
workshop; and a journal paper abstract probably falls between these extremes.</div></div></div></div></div></section><section class="slide"><div class="container_12"><div class="grid_12 "><div class="words"><div class="middle"><p class="center">What should an abstract convey?</p><div class="notes">What should an abstract convey?

you want feedback.

This is true even when sharing it among friends.
This includes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the writing is precise and readable
\item it is well within any word limits
\item any guidelines are followed exactly (if a journal asked for double spaced, vertically oriented text in wordperfect format, do it!)
\item there are no typos or formatting errors
\item citations are present and complete
